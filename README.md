# First Person Horror Made with UNITY and C#

Topics that I learned from this Project:

 Navigation and Path Finding
 Using  A* algorithm to compute but not only possible traverals,
 but the most optimized route for an agent to take to get from A to B.
 
 Creating Grids called navigation mesh to help see areas of the map which
 can be traveresed by an agent.
 
 and added NavMesh Obstacles that helps stop a nav-agent from passing through an object it will not cause the agent to recompute
 it's path. this is similar like collider object but made for Navigations system.
 
 lastly got to familirize with Mechanim, Animation State Machines and AI State Machine.
 
 Assest Models are from Mixamo.com
